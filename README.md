# shource: bash script requirmenets

Shource is designed to make it easy to have bash scripts refrence the same functions. This is useful for commonly used functions like logging, json decoding, etc. 

This repo contains two things:

- shource, the executable
- function files that can be sourced by shource


## Usage

Shource has three options:

`--create`: Create the traget file of our .src target. 
`--force`: Create uses a "tag" to mark files that were generated by shource. This allows us to not overwrite a file we created. Force will turn off that protection.
`--no-print-tag`: Do not print the tag
`--run`: Execute the script after it's created. If you do not pass `--create` then the file will be saved to a temporary file then executed from there
